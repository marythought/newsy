TODO:
- fix datetime on articles (each API uses a diff format)
- save aggregated articles in a document-oriented database (MongoDB or ?)
- return articles from a DB query instead of directly from the API calls
- add cacheing, and/or some way of checking when APIs were last queried
- sort by time published (most recent to oldest, the only way to sort things, take notes twitter and instagram)
